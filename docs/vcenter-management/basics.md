Install ESXI on a physical host

vmware host client & vSphere web client have similar web interfaces.

vSphere web client cab be used to connect to vCcenter server to manage multiple esxi hosts.

vCenter can manage multiple ESXI hosts.
vmware host client can manage a single esxi host.

vmware ESXI host client can be very useful in situations where a vCenter server is not present to manage the host. However when a vCenter server is present
it is a prefered option and provides better tools to manage infra as a whole.
